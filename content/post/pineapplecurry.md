### Difficulty: easy
### Time: 50 mins

## Ingredients:
- Coconut oil
- Shallots
- Garlic
- Thai red curry paste
- turmeric
- ginger
- Sweet potatoes
- Carrots
- Peppers
- Coconut milk
- Soy sauce
- Pineapple
- Kale
- Tofu
- Coriander
- Lemon
- Peanuts
- Chickpeas
- Quinoa 

## Instructions

Start with a huge pot, put some coconut oil in and add the garlic/shallots (a lot) until they're starting to fry. Add the turmeric/ginger/red curry paste, mix and so on. Add the potatoes/carrots/peppers and mix so that the spices are spread out properly, give it a bit of time for the flavour to absorb. Add the coconut milk so that the vegetables can boil (~ 3 400ml cans), soy sauce and pineapple, leave it until the vegetables are cooked (put a fork through a piece of potato). Add the tofu (I compress while I'm doing the rest so that it becomes firmer) and kale. 

For the quinoa, cook it in stock since it absorbs a lot of the liquid this actually makes a noticeable difference. The chickpeas I get canned and just put into the quinoa once it's ready, also leave the quinoa to rest for a bit once it's ready so that it absorbs as much of the stock as possible. Serve the curry on the quinoa and you can add coriander/lemon/peanuts.
