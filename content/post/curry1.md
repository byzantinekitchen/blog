### Difficulty: easy
### Time: 50 mins

## Ingredients:
- Coconut oil
- Garlic
- Onions
- Thai red curry paste
- turmeric
- ginger
- Sweet potatoes
- Carrots
- Red Lentils (250g)
- Green Lentils (250g)
- Coconut milk
- Coriander
- Lemon
- Brown Rice

## Instructions

Start with a huge pot, put some coconut oil in and add the garlic and onions until they are starting to fry. Add the turmeric/ginger/red curry paste, mix. Add the potatoes and carrots and mix so that the spices are spread out properly, give it a bit of time for the flavour to absorb. Add the coconut milk so that the vegetables can boil (~ 3 x 400ml cans), leave it until the vegetables are cooked (put a fork through a piece of potato). Add the lentils, vegetable stock and some water. Cook for approximately 20 minutes.
Add coriander and lemon.
